# fastBoost
fastBoost is a fast implementation of adaboost for R. It uses C++ code in the backend to provide
a much faster adaboost implementation than currently available libraries in R. This is especially
useful if your data size is large.

## Install
It is currently in very alpha stages of development. So I would urge you to wait for a couple of 
weeks until I get it to shape.

It is not submitted to CRAN yet.
If you must install it:
```{r,eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("souravc83/fastBoost")
```

## Load the package
```{r,eval = FALSE}
library("fastBoost")
```


## Functions
This package currently supports the following functions
1) adaboost()
2) real_adaboost()
3) predict.adaboost()
4) predict.real_adaboost()
5) get_tree()
6) get_error()
7) staged_error()?
8) plot.staged_error()?
9) cv.adaboost()?
