Title: a fast implementation of adaboost.M1 and real adaboost
Description: This library implements a Rcpp based blazingly fast implementation
        of adaboost.m1 and real adaboost. This will be especially  well suited 
        for big datasets. The library currently supports decision trees as the weak 
        classifier. Once the classifiers have been trained, they can be used to 
        predict new datasets. Currently, we support only binary classification task.
        In addition to calculating the final error, a staged error is also calculated
        for each additional tree. This can be used to tune the final number of 
        iterations. A plot of the staged error is also generated to help the user 
        decide.
